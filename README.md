# Avengers! Comics [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/raulh82vlc/Avengers.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/raulh82vlc/Avengers)
Avengers comics shows a list of comics from Captain America

This project uses Material design with *Clean architecture* by means of *Model-View-Presenter (MVP)* with *Repository pattern*
as well as `Dagger 2` for *Dependency Injection*, trying to respect *SOLID principles* as much as possible.

## Overview
At this open-source project, it is decoupled between `android` and `domain` modules or high level layers.

This means, `android` is strongly coupled with the Android framework and `domain` is decoupled from it, and can be re-used for other purposes when
required as is purely *Java* based, but not framework coupled.

Inside the those modules, there are some good practices being employed, for instance:
- There is an implementation of the *repository pattern* with a Network datasource (it could be extended to have others if required such as CacheDataSource, PersistenceDataSource, and so on).

*Retrofit 2* is the Network library which uses *OkHttp* as its client, this makes calls to the API, transforming the responses to models, for this purpose and properly handling
the different requests on background threads with a pool of threads which passes their use cases result and avoids to lock the
UI thread.

## Architecture design overview
The exchange between the different *layers* is as follows:
- **Repository layer**:
  - from the models coming from a concrete *data source* to the *Repository* (repository is the responsible of managing from 1 to n datasources, in this case only network datasource)
  - from the *Repository* to their associated *Interactor* (or use case)
- **Interactor layer**: from the *Interactor*, which is responsible of the *business logic* and communicating results to the *Presenter*
- **Presenter layer**: from the *Presenter*, which provides the final formatted info to a passive `View` from a UI element (fragments / activities).
Finally, this information would be passed through the UI thread.


### Material design
- This code test uses a wide range of Material design widgets from the Design support library such as:
- `AppBarLayout`, `CoordinatorLayout`, `Toolbar`, `RecyclerView`, `CardView` or `CollapsingToolbarLayout` as well as Material theme styles.

### Features
- At the main screen a list of comics from Captain America composed by thumbnail and title (a placeholder is located in case there is no image)
- Once clicked an item, the comic detail view of each comic is shown with an animation, depending if >= Lollipop
- This shows with a Parallax effect an image, then information about the ID, title, description, creators and characters appearing at the comic
- Error handling integrated for `Http` or `Connection` or `IO` issues, also empty state indicating no results when required.
- A Loader is placed each time a new request is started, to indicate the user the fact that there is an action going on
- An infinite scroll (linear one) is able to retrieve more comics by going down on the scroll
- There is a small amount of Unit test cases for the most critical parts: mainly the MD5 validation for the hash (unit test), then presenter and views (callbacks) interaction.
- Following previous statement, extracted from the documentation: hash - a md5 digest of the ts parameter, your private key and your public key (e.g. md5(ts+privateKey+publicKey)
